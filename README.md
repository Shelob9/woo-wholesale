# woo-wholesale
Simple, feature-light, WooCommerce wholesale orders plugin.

* Creates three user roles. Each one gets a discount percentage and batch size.
* Adds a order form for all products, at wholesale prices at `/cart?wholesale=true` or whatever your cart is.
* That's it. Nothing fancy.

<strong>Requires [WP Session Manager](https://github.com/ericmann/wp-session-manager)</strong>
